1.  OPENWEATHER API AND GOOGLEMAPS API ARE DUPLICATED IN INDEX.HTML AND INDEX.JS
            IDEALLY, INFO WOULD BE GATHERED IN INDEX.JS AND "PASSED" TO INDEX.HTML USING THE "EMIT" FUNCTION (SOCKET.IO)

2.  ADD REST API FOR PASSING DATA TO DANNY'S AI TEAM USING JSON

     ....OR  ADD MONGO DATABASE TO REPLACE JSON AND/OR .CSV FILE
	 
3. issue where SPO2 is reported as zero

4. sometimes ambient is reported as null?...out of synch with app?
